## Overview

This project focuses on classifying customers based on their credit scores using Machine Learning algorithms. The classification includes three categories: Good, Standard, and Poor. The goal is to help banks and credit card companies assess customers' creditworthiness and make informed decisions about issuing loans.

## Dataset

The project uses a labeled dataset containing various features such as annual income, monthly in-hand salary, number of bank accounts, credit history age, and more. The dataset is preprocessed and explored to gain insights into the factors affecting credit scores.

## Data Exploration

Explore the impact of different features on credit scores through visualizations. The project analyzes factors like annual income, monthly in-hand salary, number of bank accounts, credit history age, and more to understand their influence on credit scores.

## Machine Learning Model

A Random Forest Classifier is employed to train the credit score classification model. The features selected for the model include important factors identified during data exploration.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-score-classification.git
   cd credit-score-classification

## Viewing Plots

To view the interactive plots and visualizations in this project, it is recommended to use Google Colab. Some features may not render correctly in a static environment like Jupyter Notebook.

### How to Use Google Colab

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking on the "Open in Colab" badge.
